# 🧠 SENTRY-AI: Explainable AI for Intrusion Detection

**SENTRY-AI** is an **AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** designed to advance cybersecurity research and practice.
Built with **deep learning, explainable AI, and fusion models**, it achieved **99.99% accuracy on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark dataset** - a state-of-the-art performance for anomaly detection.

This project was created **independently and voluntarily** to support the global cybersecurity community. It is licensed under **MIT** for open academic and industry adoption.

##  Why SENTRY-AI Matters

Cybersecurity threats are growing in scale and complexity. Traditional IDS models struggle with accuracy and transparency.

**SENTRY-AI introduces:**

* **High performance** (99.99% on UNSW-NB15, surpassing baseline methods).
* **Explainability** (Grad-CAM anomaly visualisation for human validation).
* **Multi-dataset robustness** (tested on NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15).
* **Open-source availability** for researchers, enterprises, and startups.

 *This work contributes to advancing the digital technology sector by providing a reproducible, high-accuracy IDS framework available to the global community.*

##  Key Features

* **CNN anomaly detection** with Gramian Angular Field (GAF) encoding.
* **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** for unsupervised anomaly detection.
* **Fusion-based decision engine** combining CNN + VAE.
* **Grad-CAM explainability** → transparent AI, trusted by human operators.
* **Dashboard (coming soon)** → metrics, anomaly heatmaps, system monitoring.
